	* Emacs: Update color theme, with improved colors for ERB,
	whitespace, and error messages (flymake).

	* Emacs: Change the frame title so it displays the full name of
	the file that is currently being edited.

	* Emacs: Add a message to the frame title when a buffer hasn't yet
	been saved to a file.

	* Emacs: Typing while text is selected (there is an active region)
	will now replace the selection with whatever you type.

	* Emacs: Add a major-mode for editing YAML files.

	* Git: Ignore Emacs temporary auto-save files so they don't get
	added when you do a `git add .'

	* ZSH: Auto-correction is now case-sensitive and won't try to help
	you pick the correct case.

	* ZSH: The `e' alias is now a function that tries really hard to
	make sure there's a running Emacs to connect to.

	* Linux Desktop: Automatically start an Emacs daemon when you
	log-in.
