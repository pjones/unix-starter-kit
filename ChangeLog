	* Version 0.2.0 released.

	* Emacs: Configure dired to auto-revert its buffer when it is
	visited after being hidden.  This should keep dired buffers
	current with the file system.

	* Emacs: Rebind C-w to do the same thing as the shell while
	retaining the ability to kill the region.

	* Emacs: Rebind C-o and M-o to do more sensible things with
	indentation.

	* Emacs: Change the text cursor to be a vertical blinking bar, and
	the text cursor in inactive windows to a solid horizontal bar.

	* Emacs: Create a new function called `novice' that removes tool
	bars, menu bars, scroll bars, and activates ido-mode.

	* Emacs: Update color theme, with improved colors for ERB,
	whitespace, and error messages (flymake).

	* Emacs: Change the frame title so it displays the full name of
	the file that is currently being edited.

	* Emacs: Add a message to the frame title when a buffer hasn't yet
	been saved to a file.

	* Emacs: Typing while text is selected (there is an active region)
	will now replace the selection with whatever you type.

	* Emacs: Add a major-mode for editing YAML files.

	* Git: Ignore Emacs temporary auto-save files so they don't get
	added when you do a `git add .'

	* ZSH: Auto-correction is now case-sensitive and won't try to help
	you pick the correct case.

	* ZSH: The `e' alias is now a function that tries really hard to
	make sure there's a running Emacs to connect to.

	* Linux Desktop: Automatically start an Emacs daemon when you
	log-in.
